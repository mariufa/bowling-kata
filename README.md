# Bowling Kata

This is a project for handling the Bowling Kata. The folders in this project:
*  Solved: Finished plain bowling kata in different languages
*  Bonus: The bowling logic put in an api. This also includes a ReactJS frontend
*  Live: Starter projects to do Bowling Kata

## Solved
Finished plain bowling katas. Currently solved in:
* Java : `mvn clean install`
* Node: `mocha`
* Python: `python test_bowling.py`

This will run all tests, and should pass.

## Bonus
This is where I've taken the bowling solution and put in an api, or several apis. For each language.
The spring boot was done by repeating the bowling kata by testing in spring boot.

This also has a web application to communicate with the apis.

## Live
Empty project setups to do the Bowling Kata.
